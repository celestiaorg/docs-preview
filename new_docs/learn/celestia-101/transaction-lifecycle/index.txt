6:T1229,# The lifecycle of a celestia-app transaction

Users request the celestia-app to make data available by
sending `PayForBlobs` transactions. Every such transaction consists
of the identity of the sender, the data to be made available, also
referred to as the message, the data size, the namespace, and
a signature. Every block producer batches multiple `PayForBlobs`
transactions into a block.

Before proposing the block though, the producer passes it to the
state machine via ABCI++, where each `PayForBlobs` transaction is
split into a namespaced message (denoted by `Msg` in the figure below),
i.e., the data together with the namespace ID, and an executable
transaction (denoted by `e-Tx` in the figure below) that does not
contain the data, but only a commitment that can be used at a later
time to prove that the data was indeed made available.

Thus, the block data consists of data partitioned into namespaces
and executable transactions. Note that only these transactions are
executed by the Celestia state machine once the block is committed.

![Lifecycle of a celestia-app Transaction](/img/learn/tx-lifecycle.png)

Next, the block producer adds to the block header a commitment
of the block data. As
[described in the "Celestia's data availability layer" page](/learn/celestia-101/data-availability),
the commitment is the Merkle root of the _4k_ intermediate Merkle roots
(i.e., one for each row and column of the extended matrix).
To compute this commitment, the block producer performs the following operations:

- It splits the executable transactions and the namespaced data
  into shares. Every share consists of some bytes prefixed by a
  namespace. To this end, the executable transactions are associated
  with a reserved namespace.
- It arranges these shares into a square matrix (row-wise). Note that
  the shares are padded to the next power of two. The outcome square
  of size _k × k_ is referred to as the original data.
- It extends the original data to a _2k × 2k_ square matrix using
  the 2-dimensional Reed-Solomon encoding scheme described above.
  The extended shares (i.e., containing erasure data) are associated
  with another reserved namespace.
- It computes a commitment for every row and column of the extended
  matrix using the NMTs described above.

Thus, the commitment of the block data is the root of a Merkle tree
with the leaves the roots of a forest of Namespaced Merkle subtrees,
one for every row and column of the extended matrix.

## Checking data availability

![DA network](/img/learn/consensus-da.png)

To enhance connectivity, the celestia-node augments the celestia-app
with a separate libp2p network, _i.e._, the so-called _DA network_,
that serves DAS requests.

Light nodes connect to a celestia-node in the DA network, listen to
extended block headers (i.e., the block headers together with the
relevant DA metadata, such as the _4k_ intermediate Merkle roots), and
perform DAS on the received headers (i.e., ask for random data shares).

Note that although it is recommended, performing DAS is optional -- light
nodes could just trust that the data corresponding to the commitments in
the block headers was indeed made available by the Celestia DA layer.
In addition, light nodes can also submit transactions to the celestia-app,
i.e., `PayForBlobs` transactions.

While performing DAS for a block header, every light node queries Celestia
Nodes for a number of random data shares from the extended matrix and the
corresponding Merkle proofs. If all the queries are successful, then the
light node accepts the block header as valid (from a DA perspective).

If at least one of the queries fails (i.e., either the data share is not
received or the Merkle proof is invalid), then the light node rejects the
block header and tries again later. The retrial is necessary to deal with
false negatives, i.e., block headers being rejected although the block
data is available. This may happen due to network congestion for example.

Alternatively, light nodes may accept a block header although the data
is not available, i.e., a _false positive_. This is possible since the
soundness property (i.e., if an honest light node accepts a block as available,
then at least one honest bridge node will eventually have the entire block data)
is probabilistically guaranteed (for more details, take a look at the
[original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044)).

By fine tuning Celestia's parameters (e.g., the number of data shares sampled
by each light node) the likelihood of false positives can be sufficiently
reduced such that block producers have no incentive to withhold the block data.0:{"P":null,"b":"M23cO12aPLUwOope0gFHr","c":["","learn","celestia-101","transaction-lifecycle",""],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["learn",{"children":["celestia-101",{"children":["transaction-lifecycle",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/docs-preview/new_docs/_next/static/chunks/221ce6682042a4f8.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/docs-preview/new_docs/_next/static/chunks/79a6fde0ddc6e93a.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-1",{"src":"/docs-preview/new_docs/_next/static/chunks/d58d37d655ba2556.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-2",{"src":"/docs-preview/new_docs/_next/static/chunks/80586927a2b92ff4.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-3",{"src":"/docs-preview/new_docs/_next/static/chunks/809579129243fe64.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-4",{"src":"/docs-preview/new_docs/_next/static/chunks/c74eca95822c5e27.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}]],"$L2"]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L5",null,{"metadata":{"title":"The lifecycle of a celestia-app transaction","filePath":"app/learn/celestia-101/transaction-lifecycle/page.mdx","timestamp":1764957410000},"toc":[{"value":"Checking data availability","id":"checking-data-availability","depth":2}],"sourceCode":"$6","children":"$L7"}],null,"$L8"]}],{},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false],"$L9",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$a",[]],"s":false,"S":true}
