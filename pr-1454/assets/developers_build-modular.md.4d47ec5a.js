This page will give you the rundown on modular blockchains and their benefits for developers like you.</p><p>If you already know all this, <a href="#building-on-celestia">skip to the end</a> to get straight into building.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-modular-blockchain" tabindex="-1">What is a modular blockchain? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-modular-blockchain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is a modular blockchain?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>With blockchains there are more or less four core functions that they do.</p><ul><li><strong>Execution</strong>: transaction execution and state update.</li><li><strong>Settlement</strong>: finality and dispute resolution.</li><li><strong>Consensus</strong>: agreement on transaction ordering.</li><li><strong>Data availability</strong>: prove data was published to the network.</li></ul><p>Modular blockchains specialize in one or two of these functions rather than doing all of them like a monolithic blockchain. You probably know about layer 1s and layer 2s. That’s the general idea.</p><p>A typical example of a modular blockchain you might’ve heard of is a rollup. Rollups host smart contracts and execute transactions, much like any monolithic chain. But, the data of those transactions get sent to a layer 1 blockchain to carry out the remaining functions.</p><p>If you want to brush up on your understanding of modular blockchains, head over to <a href="https://celestia.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">learn modular</a>.</p><h2 id="ease-of-deploying-a-chain" tabindex="-1">Ease of deploying a chain <a class="header-anchor" href="#ease-of-deploying-a-chain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ease of deploying a chain&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One of the goals of modular blockchains is to make it as easy to deploy a blockchain as a smart contract. There are a few unique ways that modular blockchains can significantly reduce the cost of deploying a new blockchain.</p><ol><li><strong>No validator set is required</strong>. Rollups can deploy without sourcing their own set of validators or sequencers.</li><li><strong>Inherit security from the start</strong>. Rollups don’t need to build all their security from scratch.</li><li><strong>Any part of the stack can be delegated</strong>. Development time can be reduced by outsourcing functions of the rollup to external providers.</li></ol><p>All in all, builders will be able to outsource as much of the stack as they need. Deploying a new blockchain will be as simple as clicking a few options to initialize a production-ready rollup.</p><h2 id="scaling" tabindex="-1">Scaling <a class="header-anchor" href="#scaling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Scaling&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Of course, a much higher scale is necessary if we want to support many more users. And modular blockchains use some new innovative technologies that can help us get there.</p><ul><li><a href="https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability-sampling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Data availability sampling</a> enables modular blockchains like Celestia to scale data availability with the number of light nodes - that means more capacity for rollups.</li><li><strong>Fraud and validity proofs</strong> make rollups vastly more efficient to verify. Nodes only need to verify a small proof of transaction validity (<a href="https://celestia.org/glossary/validity-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">validity proof</a>) or assume transactions are valid by default (<a href="https://celestia.org/glossary/state-transition-fraud-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fraud proof</a>). This means rollups don’t require every node in the network to re-execute every transaction.</li></ul><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="image"></p><ul><li><strong>Decoupling execution from consensus</strong> lets developers define the VM that best fits the scaling needs of their application.</li><li><strong>Separating applications</strong> across multiple rollups isolates congestion. If an application congests the execution capacity of one rollup, all other rollups remain unaffected in their execution capacity.</li></ul><p>All these scaling properties combined make new types of applications and features possible, like onchain gaming, dynamic metadata, and ephemeral rollups, to name a few.</p><h2 id="customizability" tabindex="-1">Customizability <a class="header-anchor" href="#customizability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Customizability&quot;">​</a></h2><p>By design, modular blockchains don’t lock in any feature set. They promote experimentation and customization.</p><p>Remember how decoupling execution from consensus enables VM customizability? Well, rollups are the execution component. Applications can run on their own rollup and adjust the VM to maximize their application&#39;s performance. Developers have that flexibility because Celestia&#39;s execution logic doesn&#39;t restrict rollups.</p><p>Basically, rollups can be customized to integrate any new or existing VM stack.</p><p>With existing rollup frameworks, developers can run rollup testnets using the EVM or Cosmos SDK. In the future, one can imagine a variety of VMs that rollup frameworks support, providing developers with more out-of-the-box options for their applications.</p><p>Some customizations that could be made to a rollup&#39;s VM include custom precompiles, changing transaction processing from sequential to parallel, or adding support for private smart contracts.</p><p>All of this only scratches the surface.</p><h2 id="building-on-celestia" tabindex="-1">Building on Celestia <a class="header-anchor" href="#building-on-celestia" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Building on Celestia&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, you’re ready to start experimenting and building on Celestia?
