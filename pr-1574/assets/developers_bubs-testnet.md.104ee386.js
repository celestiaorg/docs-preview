This integration can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/celestiaorg/optimism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@celestiaorg/optimism repository</a>. The testnet is hosted by <a href="https://caldera.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Caldera</a>, who makes it easy to launch rollups with no code required.</p><p>In this setup, data handling is accomplished in two ways. Firstly, data is written to the DA layer, in this case, Celestia (on the <a href="./../nodes/mocha-testnet">Mocha testnet</a>). Then, the data commitment is written to the <code>op-batcher</code>. When reading, the <code>op-node</code> retrieves the data back from the DA layer by first reading the data commitment from the <code>op-batcher</code>, then reading the data from the DA layer using the data commitment. Hence, while previously <code>op-node</code> was reading from <code>calldata</code> on Ethereum, it now reads data from Celestia. <a href="https://mocha-4.celenium.io/namespace/000000000000000000000000000000000000ca1de12ad45362e77e87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">View the namespace for Bubs on Celestia&#39;s Mocha testnet</a>.</p><p>The tools involved in the data handling process include <code>op-batcher</code>, which batches up rollup blocks and posts them to Ethereum, <code>op-geth</code> that handles execution, and <code>op-proposer</code> responsible for state commitment submission.</p><p>By using Celestia as a DA layer, existing L2s can switch from posting their data as <code>calldata</code> on Ethereum to posting to Celestia. The commitment to the block is posted on Celestia, which is purpose-built for data availability. This is more scalable than the traditional method of posting this data as <code>calldata</code> on monolithic chains.</p><h2 id="building-on-bubs" tabindex="-1">Building on Bubs <a class="header-anchor" href="#building-on-bubs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Building on Bubs&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Bubs Testnet provides a robust environment for developers to test their Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) applications.
