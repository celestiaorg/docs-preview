If you wish for the Blobstream X contract to be updated at a different cadence, then you have several different options for how to update the smart contract.</p><p>To request proofs to be submitted to the Blobstream X contract at a different cadence, you can do one of the following:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> The requested proof ranges cannot include blocks that were already used in a previous batch. The ranges should start from the last proven block, aka, <a href="https://github.com/succinctlabs/blobstreamx/blob/aac0842f17056e5343f66de7df44020c1637e8b7/contracts/src/BlobstreamX.sol#L16-L17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>latest_block</code></a> and they should end in a block already committed by Celestia. In other words, it&#39;s the end-inclusive range defined by <code>[latest_block, target_block]</code> with <code>target_block</code> &lt;= Celestia tip.</p></blockquote><h2 id="local-proving" tabindex="-1">Local proving <a class="header-anchor" href="#local-proving" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Local proving&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To run the Blobstream X operator with local proving, follow this <a href="https://hackmd.io/@succinctlabs/HJE7XRrup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">guide</a>.</p><p>Local proving allows self-generating the proofs and submitting them to an existing BlobstreamX contract. Alternatively, if a team needs a very specific cadence that starts at very specific heights, they can deploy their own BlobstreamX contract and submit proofs to it.
