Currently, settlement and DA for Optimism are on Ethereum, both onchain. <code>op-batcher</code> batches up rollup blocks and posts to Ethereum.</p><p>The integration of OP Stack with Celestia underneath for DA allows rollup operators to reduce overhead that is associated with posting data as <code>calldata</code> on Ethereum. Instead, <code>op-batcher</code> batches up rollup blocks and posts them to Celestia&#39;s DA network.</p><p>Data is managed in two ways. First, data is written to the data availability (DA) layer i.e. in this case Celestia, then the data commitment is written to the <code>op-batcher</code>. When reading <code>op-node</code> simply reads the data back from the DA layer by reading the data commitment from the <code>op-batcher</code> first, then reading the data from the DA layer using the data commitment. While previously <code>op-node</code> was reading from <code>calldata</code> on Ethereum, it now reads data from Celestia.</p><p>There are a few tools involved in the data handling process. <code>op-batcher</code> batches up rollup blocks and posts them to Ethereum. <code>op-geth</code> handles execution, while <code>op-proposer</code> is responsible for state commitment submission.</p><p>By using Celestia as a DA layer, existing L2s can switch from posting their data as <code>calldata</code> on Ethereum, to posting to Celestia. The commitment to the block is posted on Celestia, which is purpose-built for data availability. This is a more scalable than the traditional method of posting this data as <code>calldata</code> on monolithic chains.</p><h3 id="github-repository" tabindex="-1">GitHub repository <a class="header-anchor" href="#github-repository" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;GitHub repository&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Find the <a href="https://github.com/celestiaorg/optimism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">repository for this integration</a> at <code>https://github.com/celestiaorg/optimism</code>.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>This is a <strong>beta integration</strong> and we are working on resolving <a href="https://github.com/celestiaorg/optimism/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">open issues</a>.</p></div><h2 id="next-steps" tabindex="-1">Next steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Next steps&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now that you understand the integration, you can start learning about the <a href="./bubs-testnet">Bubs testnet</a>, built with OP Stack and Celestia!
