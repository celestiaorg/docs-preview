This process is called a network upgrade, which can be breaking or non-breaking. During planned network upgrades the community will coordinate to prepare for the upcoming upgrade. Breaking network upgrades are not backward-compatible with older versions of the network software, which is why it is important that validators upgrade their software to continue validating on the network. Non-breaking network upgrades are backward-compatible and require less coordination.</p><h2 id="network-upgrade-coordination" tabindex="-1">Network upgrade coordination <a class="header-anchor" href="#network-upgrade-coordination" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Network upgrade coordination&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As of the Lemongrass upgrade in September 2024, Celestia has implemented <a href="https://cips.celestia.org/cip-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CIP-10</a>, which establishes two methods for coordinating network upgrades:</p><ol><li><strong>Pre-programmed height</strong>: Used for the Lemongrass network upgrade (v2)</li><li><strong>In-protocol signaling</strong>: Used for all subsequent upgrades (v3+)</li></ol><p>Under the in-protocol signaling mechanism, validators submit messages to signal their readiness and preference for the next version.
