Then the <code>Read</code> logic takes care of taking the deserialized Blob Pointer struct and consuming it in order to fetch the data from Celestia and additionally inform the fetcher about the position of the data on Celestia (we&#39;ll get back to this in the next section).</p><p>The following represents a non-exhaustive list of considerations when running a Batch Poster node for a chain with Celestia underneath:</p><ul><li>You will need to use a consensus node RPC endpoint, you can <a href="/docs-preview/pr-1930/how-to-guides/mocha-testnet#community-rpc-endpoints">find a list of them for Mocha</a></li><li>The Batch Poster will only post a Celestia batch to the underlying chain if the height for which it posted is in a recent range in BlobstreamX and if the verification succeeds, otherwise it will discard the batch.

Because only data roots that can be confirmed on Blobstream get accepted into the sequencer inbox, one can have a high degree of certainty that the canonical data root being unpeeled as well as the row roots are in fact correct.</p><h3 id="blobstream-x-implementation" tabindex="-1">Blobstream X implementation <a class="header-anchor" href="#blobstream-x-implementation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Blobstream X implementation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Finally, the integration only accepts batches with information that can be confirmed on BlobstreamX, which gives us a high certainty that data was made available on Celestia.</p><p>You can see how BlobstreamX is integrated into the <code>SequencerInbox.sol</code> contract <a href="https://github.com/celestiaorg/nitro-contracts/blob/celestia-v1.2.1/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L584-L630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, which allows us to discard batches with otherwise faulty data roots, thus giving us a high degree of confidence that the data root can be safely unpacked in case of a challenge.</p><p>The Celestia and Arbitrum integration also <a href="/docs-preview/pr-1930/how-to-guides/blobstream">includes Blobstream</a>, which relays commitments to Celestia’s data root to an onchain light client on Ethereum.
