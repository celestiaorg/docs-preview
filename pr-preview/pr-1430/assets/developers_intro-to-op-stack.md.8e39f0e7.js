This rewards individuals for their positive contributions to the collective.</p><p>Optimism addresses crypto ecosystem coordination failures, like funding public goods and infrastructure. The OP Stack fosters collaboration and prevents redundancy by creating a shared, open-source system for developing new L2 blockchains within the proposed Superchain ecosystem.</p><p>As Optimism evolves, the OP Stack will adapt to include components from blockchain infrastructure to governance systems. This software suite aims to simplify L2 blockchain creation and support the Optimism ecosystem&#39;s growth and development.</p><p>Learn <a href="https://www.optimism.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">more about Optimism</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-celestia" tabindex="-1">What is Celestia? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-celestia" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is Celestia?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Celestia is a modular consensus and data network, built to enable anyone to easily deploy their own blockchain with minimal overhead.</p><p>Celestia is a minimal blockchain that only orders and publishes transactions and does not execute them. By decoupling the consensus and application execution layers, Celestia modularizes the blockchain technology stack and unlocks new possibilities for decentralized application builders.

First, data is written to the data availability (DA) layer i.e. in this case Celestia, then the data commitment is written to the <code>op-batcher</code>. When reading <code>op-node</code> simply reads the data back from the DA layer by reading the data commitment from the <code>op-batcher</code> first, then reading the data from the DA layer using the data commitment. Hence, while previously <code>op-node</code> was reading from calldata on Ethereum, but now it reads data from Celestia.</p><p>There are a few tools involved in the data handling process. <code>op-batcher</code> batches up rollup blocks and posts them to Ethereum. <code>op-geth</code> handles execution, while <code>op-proposer</code> is responsible for state commitment submission.</p><p>By using Celestia as a DA layer, existing L2s can switch from posting their data as <code>calldata</code> on Ethereum, to posting to Celestia. The commitment to the block is posted on Celestia, which is purpose-built for data availability. This is a more scalable than the traditional method of posting this data as <code>calldata</code> on monolithic chains.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to go modular, bedrock has made it easy to swap this out!</p><h2 id="next-steps" tabindex="-1">Next steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Next steps&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now that you understand the integration, you can start learning about the <a href="./bubs-testnet">Bubs testnet</a>, built with OP Stack and Celestia!
